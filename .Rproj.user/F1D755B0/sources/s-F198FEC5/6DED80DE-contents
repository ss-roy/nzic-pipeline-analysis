How to run?

You can run each of those files individually by,

1. Open the file and click ‘Source’

(Or)

2. source(“source/ filename.R”)

3. You can also run linear model 2 for a sector of your choice by typing the following command on your console

system("Rscript source/5_autorrun.R 'Transport' ")


Packages needed to run the code: 
readxl, dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate, stringr, tidyr

Code to install the package: (Copy/Paste and Run)
if (!require(“readxl”)) install.packages("readxl")
if (!require(“tidyr”)) install.packages("tidyr")
if (!require("dplyr")) install.packages("dplyr")
if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require("lubridate")) install.packages("lubridate")
if (!require("stringr")) install.packages("stringr")
