# Script Info -------------------------------------------------------------


# This script fits a linear model for features generated from pipeline data

# A linear regression model (delay_model_1) is fitted to predict total_delay based on several features, including:
# avg_group_delay (average regional delay), budget_min and budget_max (estimated project budget range), 
# planned_duration (planned project duration), funding_status_indicator (whether funding is confirmed),
# project_status_indicator (projectâ€™s planning status).

# Diagnostic plots (Scale-Location plot, residuals histogram) are generated to check model assumptions like homoscedasticity and normality of residuals.
# Additional visualizations show residuals vs. fitted values and predicted vs. actual values for further model validation.

# The predicted delay values are scaled within each project region and sector.
# A likelihood score is computed by normalizing the predicted delays on a scale of 0 to 100%. 
# This gives a measure of the probability of project completion relative to delay

# Scaling the predicted delays between 0 and 1 for each region and sector, 
# converting them to percentages to represent the "likelihood" of project completion.

# Boxplots and violin plots are generated to visualize:
# Predicted delays across regions and sectors.
# Likelihood of project completion, faceted by sector and region.
