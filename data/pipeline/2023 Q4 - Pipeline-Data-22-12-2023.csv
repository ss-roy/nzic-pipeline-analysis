IP009698,2023-11-22,Selwyn District Council,Leeston Library and Community Centre.,SDC are considering a combined community centre/library for Leeston that could provide efficiencies in terms of capital build and operating costs. The planned building would be around 900m2 and would combine library (arts  culture and lifelong learning services)  Council service centre and community recreation and meeting spaces creating a vibrant community hub for Leeston. The mix of uses and spaces needs to reflect both the local and network requirements as well as creating a point of difference. To achieve this a focus on culture and heritage is proposed including connection to the cultural narrative of the locality especially in terms of the proximity to Te Waihora and Te Taumutu Marae (Te Pā o Moki). Potential for contributing to indoor court space is also included as part of the project.

IP009705,2023-11-22,Selwyn District Council,Prebbleton Community Centre.,A proposal for a new Prebbleton Community Centre was included in the 2018-2028 Long term Plan. However  following consultation on the Annual Plan 2020/21  the project was deferred until the next Long-term Plan to ensure more information on the location and community needs could be gathered. Demand for a new facility to service Prebbleton is evident with the existing public hall  although not owned by Council  being earthquake prone and nearing the end of its life. The new community centre is planned to be a flexible facility that can cater for a variety of uses including community groups  meetings  recreation and leisure programmes and is most likely to be located on Prebbleton Reserve. It would also be built to Importance Level 4 seismic standards so that it can be used as an emergency welfare centre. This adds to the cost but Council has a statutory obligation to provide an emergency centre to this standard somewhere in the District.,,In planning,Funding source confirmed,To be determined,To be determined,Canterbury,,,Community facilities,5 - 25 million,,,,,,,2025-Q1,2028-Q1,,,,,

NZTA_117702016,2023-11-20,Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency,20Connect (Airport Access Imps).,This project was previously called South-West Auckland and Airport Corridor.Waka Kotahi (WK)  alongside investment partners Auckland Transport (AT) and Auckland International Airport Limited (AIAL) are investigating improvements to customer journey experiences and access to and from Auckland International Airport and the surrounding area.Reliable and timely access for customers and goods to and from the airport and its surrounding area is limited by lack of travel choice  leading to a poor journey experience and putting New Zealand’s economic potential at risk. This is significantly exacerbated by growing activity.The primary purpose of this project is to develop a medium to long-term response to increasing airport demand from south and east Auckland. This is a multi stage programme of improvements  starting with the Early Improvements package.The Early Improvements package (ETA 2021) includes the SH20B improvements (lead by WK and co-funded by AIAL  the project involves widening of SH20B to incorporate new bus lanes  Shared User Path  and safety improvements to the corridor)  Puhinui Station and Puhinui Road improvements (lead by AT). The primary objective for this programme of work is to improve access to jobs and enable more efficient movement of goods  contributing towards economic growth and productivity.

NZTA_143202020,2023-11-20,Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency,Auckland Network Optimisation Programme.,High economic growth has contributed to reduced levels of service for customers using Auckland's transport system. With the city's population projected to increase by 45% to 2.2 million over the next 30 years  accompanied by a 40% increase in jobs to over 850 000  the increased demand for travel  will further negatively impact customer journeys. Left unaddressed  or without alternatives for travel  the economic and social opportunities that Auckland's growth can provide will be undermined. Relying on expanded infrastructure to improve service levels is economically inefficient and unsustainable. An enhanced emphasis is required to make better use of existing transport systems and influence travel demand. Therefore  optimisation of the transport system has a key role to play in enhancing journey experiences for customers across the transport system  regardless of mode. Optimisation includes high benefit  but small-scale  initiatives that can be implemented quickly  which optimise the movement of people and goods whilst appropriately balancing movement with 'place' and the need for liveable communities. Optimisation is therefore a key way of ensuring we have an economically efficient transport system. Examples of optimisation initiatives include traffic light optimisation  dynamic lanes  high occupancy vehicle lanes  freight lanes and other priority measures and improvements to support bus / cycle / pedestrian priority. The PBC for this initiative was completed 2019  approved 2020. The remainder of this business case will investigate a refresh of the Auckland network operating plan  a programme of optimisation activities  possible standard interventions and a tool. This work will align with  and feed into  the National Network Optimisation business case.,,Under construction,Funded for delivery,To be determined,To be determined,Auckland,,,Transport,5 - 25 million,,,,,,,2020-Q1,2025-Q2,,,,,

NZTA_144152020,2023-11-20,Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency,SH1 Bulls to Sanson CI - Pukenui Rd IS.,The site of the proposed rural roundabout is at the intersection of State Highway 1 and Pukenui Road  approximately midway between Bulls and Sanson on a sweeping bend. Pukenui Road is the main road servicing the Royal NZ Air Force’s Ohakea air base resulting in the intersection being used by air force personnel on their commute to and from Bulls  Sanson and Palmerston North.SH1 is an undivided two-lane state highway with a posted speed limit of 100km/h and an ONRC classification of National. Traffic volumes on SH1 between Tangimoana Road and Sanson in 2019 were 15 049 AADT with 12.5 percent of heavy vehicles.Pukenui Road is a two-lane undivided road under the administration of the RNZAF and does not have an ONRC classification. It has a posted speed limit of 50km/h. Pukenui Road has approximately 1 500 to 2 000 ADT (2014) and approximately 6.8 percent of heavy vehicles.The intersection currently consists of single northbound and southbound through lanes on SH1 along with a left turn slip lane and a right turn bay for state highway traffic turning into Pukenui Road. Pukenui Road has a left turn lane for northbound traffic and a stop controlled right turn lane for southbound traffic.Between Tangimoana Road to the north and the intersection  a southbound passing lane was removed from SH1 in 2019 with the righthand lane being replaced with a wide median painted with diagonal bars.400m to the south of the intersection is the NZ Police Highway Patrol base and commercial vehicle weigh station.The topography at and surrounding the intersection is flat  with the air base bordering the south-western quadrant and farmland bordering the north-western quadrant and eastern side.,,Under construction,Funded for delivery,Open,Construct only,Manawatū - Whanganui,,,Transport,5 - 25 million,,,,,,,2020-Q3,2025-Q3,,,,,
NZTA_125902017,2023-11-20,Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency,SH1 Cambridge to Piarere Long Term.,This project is for long term improvements to address safety & future capacity issues on the stretch of SH1 between the Cambridge Section of the Waikato Expressway & Piarere  including the long-term form of the future SH1/29 intersection. The key problems include the high numbers of deaths & serious injuries and the large number of side roads & private accesses resulting in a medium/high risk profile for the corridor. Serious incidents result in closures of the road for significant periods. This section of SH1 is where drivers travelling south will transition from the high standard expressway to an undivided two-lane lane rural road with passing lanes. It falls within the Board endorsed (2006)  preferred route between Auckland  Hamilton and Tauranga or Tirau (and further south).Increasing conflict between local & through traffic is likely to negatively impact on journey time reliability & undermine the benefits of the SH1 Waikato Expressway. Following completion of the Waikato Expressway (2021) it is expected that there will be an increase in traffic volumes by up to 2000-3000 vehicles a day (from poorer quality routes)  with a further increase in future years.Re-evaluation direction: Board Paper 2018/11/1299 (meeting date 9 November 2019)  SUMMARYThe re-evaluation has concluded there is a need to address the safety issues between Cambridge and Piarere and Te Poi and Tauriko. Achieving travel time reliability benefits within these corridors is not an investment priority at this time.For Cambridge to Piarere online safety improvements will take place in the short and medium term. Improvements are likely to be based on median and side barriers to improve safety. The business case will be completed to explore the optimal long term and strategic route and enable route protection if required. The SH1/SH29 Piarere intersection will be upgraded to improve safety  once the long-term solution is confirmedImproved Levels of Service will be achieved by:Continued delivery of the current safety works whilst exploring further online safety improvements (centreline treatments and side barriers) to significantly reduce the safety risk.The current business case will be completed and identify the best long term (LT) corridor option that delivers optimal strategic option. Appropriate route protection for the long-term strategic route will take place.Piarere (SH1/29 Intersection): Complete intersection improvements to improve safety. Improvements will be undertaken cognisant of the longer-term option.Next steps from 9 Nov Bd Paper – subject to funding(from 9 Nov Board Paper):1. Start design work for enhanced online safety improvements to enable implementation (Mar 2019)2. Complete DBC to confirm longer term strategic offline option (May 2019)3. Start SH1/29 intersection safety improvement design (Aug 2019)4.

NZTA_144162020,2023-11-20,Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency,SH1 Oamaru-Dunedin (Hampden-Palmerston).,The corridor is an undivided 2-lane road with an ONRC classification of National and a 2019 AADT of approx. 5 000 vehicles per day (with 14% heavy vehicles). The corridor is posted at 100 km/h except for a 300m RIAWS section that is 70km/h (at Moeraki Boulders Road intersection) when activated by turning traffic. The geometry of the corridor is quite undulating and winding throughout  with vertical crests often marked with no-passing lines  but horizontal curves with poor passing sight distance are not consistently marked with no-passing lines. Edge line ATP is present for most of the corridor and there are right turn bays for key intersections leading to settlements such as Moeraki and Shag Point.This corridor includes six bridges  one rail overpass structure and two large culverts. There is a 7km section of coastal road that has coastal erosion problems and large unprotected drop offs as well as several well used rest areas. Sealed shoulders throughout the corridor are generally 1.0m wide with 3.5m wide lanes. A key intersection in the corridor is with the Moeraki Boulders Road which leads to the Moeraki Boulders tourist attraction. Power poles are located approximately 2-5m away from the edge line for around half (52%) of the corridor. The main South Island rail corridor runs close to the road corridor for a large portion of the length. A Single Stage Business Case (SSBC) was drafted by the Safe Roads Alliance for the full corridor SH1 Oamaru to Dunedin. This SSBC was put on hold during the consideration of short list options. The SSBC investigation up to this stage helped to inform the development of this SSI funding application.The Herbert to Hampden section to the north has already had an SSI application for pre-implementation approved (May 2019) for wide centreline and roadside barriers.This SSI funding application is for design funding. Construction costs have been estimated to inform this application and will be confirmed once the scope of works has been confirmed during the design phase.The Hampden to Palmerston improvements project is included in the Safe Network Programme. The project was assessed by the Safe Network Programme and wider project teams for corridor complexity and risk. It was agreed by all parties that the standard safety intervention (SSI) investment pathway applies to this corridor.,,In Planning,Funding source to be confirmed,To be determined,To be determined,Otago,,,Transport,1 - 5 million,,,,,,,2020-Q4,2025-Q2,,,,,

The outcomes of the IBC has been discussed between the Inter Regional Journeys Portfolio and the SNP  with agreement to advance the above SSI treatments. The findings and recommendations of the IBC have informed this funding application. The IBC makes a recommendation of a wide centreline treatment for these sections of state highway (Taupo Airport to Waitahanui). These draft findings are under review by the IRJ portfolio  in the context of the Safe System Approach. The Safe System Approach suggests that corridors with traffic volumes &gt;6 000 vehicles per day (AADT) and a speed limit &gt; 80 km/hr should be addressed with a median barrier to reduce head on risk. A median barrier treatment is supported by the traffic volumes on the corridor and the speed limits subsequent to the speed review noted above. This application seeks funding to design a median barrier treatment for this section  whilst further review of the findings of the draft IBC  and any ongoing consultation  is undertaken during the design process. A design approach is proposed that makes provision for a final decision on whether to proceed with a median barrier or wide centreline treatment (using the same cross section as for median barrier) to be made prior to an application for implementation funding. The design phase will start with elements that are consistent with both treatments (median barrier or wide centreline).",,In Planning,Funding source to be confirmed,To be determined,To be determined,Waikato,,,Transport,50 - 100 million,,,,,,,2021-Q2,2028-Q2,,,,,

NZTA_140392019,2023-11-20,Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency,SH22: SH1 Drury to Paerata (corridor).,The SH22 corridor has significant safety issues  with 22 deaths and serious injuries (DSIs) recorded over the 5-year period between 2014-18. 59% of these are head-on type DSI  which reflects the high traffic volumes and the existing form of the corridor. Due to the high risk  high severity outcomes of head-on type crashes  a combination of median and side barrier  roundabouts and turn around bays are considered the most effective treatment option. The previous design stage has struggled to define scope that meets the SSI requirements and budget expectations. Confidence in the accuracy of the current preliminary design estimate is low. The project scope is being adjusted to make best use of the available funds to improve safety while making progress.,,In Planning,Funding source to be confirmed,To be determined,To be determined,Auckland,,,Transport,1 - 5 million,,,,,,,2019-Q4,2025-Q2,,,,,

Once project gets funded  the ICP should come off  and the NPRB level should be changed.Programme management and delivery for the Western bay of Plenty sub-region.A programme business case has been developed for improving access forthe Wellington Port area. The port area is intersected and accessedfrom the local roads Aotea and Waterloo Quay  and has a range of usesincluding the ferry terminals  Centreport activities  the Kiwirailyards  and freight forwarding companies. The programme business caseconsiders the range of interventions to address the efficient movementof freight and people accessing these activities  and the commutingpublic who use the Quays to access the Wellington CBD. It is integratedwith the other two programme business cases on SH2 because of the portsrole as a key attractor for freight that travel along the SH2 corridor the distributor role the Quays serve for commuters from SH2  and therole the ferries play in connecting the north and south islands.The Wellington City Council is the main business problem owner as theprimary access into and out of the Port Area is from the local roadsAotea Quay and Waterloo Quay. The Transport Agency has project managedthe delivery of the programme business case  but are a key investmentpartner in the larger scale alternative programmes.The primary inter-dependencies for this programme business case is itsintegration with the Ngauranga to Airport business case (let’s Get WellyMoving)  the redevelopment of the northern ferry terminal where theInterislander operates (commonly referred to as Project Phoenix)  andthe future growth trajectory of the Centreport business and its plans tocapture more of the contestable freight from the central north island.The recommended programme is a set of infrastructure and operationalimprovements on the local road and within the Port Area  and othernon-infrastructure changes. Investment in the recommended programme lieswith Wellington City Council and investment partners due to theinterventions identified being located on local road  and within theport area. It was considered by the stakeholders that the recommendedprogramme would deliver well against the investment objectives relativeto the costs.State highway investment by the Transport Agency will be based onadditional programmes based on triggers associated with the futureredevelopment of the ferry terminal area (Project Phoenix)  changes tothe network capacity initiated by the Ngauranga to Airport business case(let’s Get Welly Moving)  and any substantial growth in Centreportsfreight task.

IP009967,2023-12-05,Auckland Council,Waitakere War Memorial Remedial Works.,Waitakere War Memorial is an Auckland Council closed landfill located in Waitakere village in rural north west of Auckland. The 2ha landfill was operated as a bale fill landfill between March 1981 to February 1982. The landfill site is used primarily as a recreational park with limited and informal sports facilities  and there is also a small community hall  playground and skate park on the site. The site is considered as a high-risk site by the Auckland Council Closed Landfill and Contaminated Land Response team (CLCLR) and has the highest annual expenditure per landfill size within CLCLR’s portfolio. This is due to the cartage and trade waste disposal costs associated with high leachate generation from the site. The site also contains landfill gas which has the potential to migrate toward nearby receptors such as the adjacent community hall.,,Early planning,Funding source confirmed,Selective,Construct only,Auckland,,,Other not specified,1 - 5 million,,2020-Q3,,2021-Q1,,2024-Q2,2020-Q3,2024-Q2,,,procurement@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz,,

IP009970,2023-12-05,Auckland Council,Claris Landfill Rehabilitation and Closure Works.,The Claris Landfill on Great Barrier Island provides essential services to the local community. The landfill receives household  commercial waste and septic tank wastes for permanent disposal to ground at the site. It is the only waste disposal facility on the island and existing consents allow for this until 2027. The site is also currently used for waste related activities to consolidate and temporarily store materials  such as glass  metal  and plastics  prior to their transport off the island. Consents require council to prepare a landfill closure plan to identify the works needed for final landfill closure and to provide for future landfill aftercare arrangements.Waste has been placed outside the consented boundary  and in some areas waste has been filled outside consented design elevation and the 4H:1V outside batter profiles. Outside batter slopes are approaching 1H:1V in some areas. This means that the landfill is not compliant with consent conditions. Council is required to rehabilitate the landfill to achieve compliance with consents. The landfill closure plan and final designs will also be developed as part of the rehabilitation project. The final scope and staging for the rehabilitation and closure works will be confirmed following the investigation phase and development of preliminary design options.The scope and timing for the landfill rehabilitation and closure works will affect the ability of council to carry out landfill operations and waste related activities on the landfill site. Where possible  landfill rehabilitation designs will maximise the potential future uses of the site after initial rehabilitation works and following final landfill closure.The Engineering & Technical Services department is responsible for landfill delivery  and closed landfill maintenance and monitoring. The Waste Solutions department is responsible for managing the landfill operations and waste related activities on the site.

We also have a responsibility to understand natural hazards along the whole coastline  including current erosion rates of cliffs and changes in beach levels. We need topographical  photographic or similar data to be collected along our coastline to inform our asset management  to understand our hazard exposure  and to provide a baseline for future erosion studies. We anticipate that this will comprise high-resolution oblique LiDAR with RGB photography flown at low altitude from a helicopter or similar  but are open to alternative methods that can meet our objectives. We require the LiDAR (or similar) data to be classified according to reflector type  and processed to create as-built data for coastal assets giving data such as crest heights. We also require the LiDAR data to be compared against previous LiDAR data collected in 2019 for cliffs on the North Shore to identify changes and give an assessment of the rate of coastal erosion.,,In planning,Funding source confirmed,Selective,Construct only,Auckland,,,Other not specified,1 - 5 million,2021-Q2,2022-Q4,,2022-Q4,,,2023-Q2,2023-Q4,,,procurement@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz,,

The consequence of this is that we are limited in the number of locations and cameras that can be viewed at any one time reducing the visibility of sites and staff and our overview of critical incidents.• This team manages access control for 197 separate buildings and 282 building alarm systems but have no sitemaps displayed to identify door locations or alarms. This inhibits the quick identification of the actual location of alarm activations.• They have the capability to remotely lock down 181 council sites but no planning or operational space to deploy to. As a result  it is difficult to assemble members of the security team together in one space in the event of a significant event to coordinate a response.• On average the security team is responding to 80-100 security incidents a month of varying degrees of severity while dealing with over 70 CCTV requests from Police and council business units.• The Security Specialists often deal with sensitive and confidential which is currently being managed in an unrestricted  open plan office environment.• The building management system (BMS) controls and monitors the HVAC controls  lighting and security systems  it ensures that the building is operating efficiently and effectively  it can also detect various alarms  including fire alarms and security alarms.

The rationale was that the area identified will only be used as a media room for a very small percentage of time and that it can be used as meeting rooms by the rest of the building tenants as and when required. The basis of utilization would be that it is first and foremost a media room and that media requirements will take precedence over normal meetings.
