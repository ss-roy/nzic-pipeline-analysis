The mix of uses and spaces needs to reflect both the local and network requirements as well as creating a point of difference. To achieve this a focus on culture and heritage is proposed including connection to the cultural narrative of the locality especially in terms of the proximity to Te Waihora and Te Taumutu Marae (Te Pā o Moki).

Demand for a new facility to service Prebbleton is evident with the existing public hall  although not owned by Council  being earthquake prone and nearing the end of its life. The new community centre is planned to be a flexible facility that can cater for a variety of uses including community groups  meetings  recreation and leisure programmes and is most likely to be located on Prebbleton Reserve. It would also be built to Importance Level 4 seismic standards so that it can be used as an emergency welfare centre.

Planning for the park will start in 2021/22 but development is not programmed to start until 2024/25. This allows time to complete planning and designation processes and fully understand the key uses and the future interface with neighbouring land.

IP009967,27/09/2023,Auckland Council,Waitakere War Memorial Remedial Works.,Waitakere War Memorial is an Auckland Council closed landfill located in Waitakere village in rural north west of Auckland. The 2ha landfill was operated as a bale fill landfill between March 1981 to February 1982. The landfill site is used primarily as a recreational park with limited and informal sports facilities  and there is also a small community hall  playground and skate park on the site. The site is considered as a high-risk site by the Auckland Council Closed Landfill and Contaminated Land Response team (CLCLR) and has the highest annual expenditure per landfill size within CLCLR’s portfolio. This is due to the cartage and trade waste disposal costs associated with high leachate generation from the site. The site also contains landfill gas which has the potential to migrate toward nearby receptors such as the adjacent community hall. .,,Early Planning,Funding source confirmed,Selective,Construct Only,Auckland,,,Other not specified,1 - 5 million,,2020-Q3,,2021-Q1,,2024-Q2,2020-Q3,2024-Q2,,,procurement@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz,,

IP009970,27/09/2023,Auckland Council,Claris Landfill Rehabilitation and Closure Works.,The Claris Landfill on Great Barrier Island provides essential services to the local community. The landfill receives household  commercial waste and septic tank wastes for permanent disposal to ground at the site. It is the only waste disposal facility on the island and existing consents allow for this until 2027. The site is also currently used for waste related activities to consolidate and temporarily store materials  such as glass  metal  and plastics  prior to their transport off the island. Consents require council to prepare a landfill closure plan to identify the works needed for final landfill closure and to provide for future landfill aftercare arrangements.Waste has been placed outside the consented boundary  and in some areas waste has been filled outside consented design elevation and the 4H:1V outside batter profiles. Outside batter slopes are approaching 1H:1V in some areas. This means that the landfill is not compliant with consent conditions. Council is required to rehabilitate the landfill to achieve compliance with consents. The landfill closure plan and final designs will also be developed as part of the rehabilitation project. The final scope and staging for the rehabilitation and closure works will be confirmed following the investigation phase and development of preliminary design options.The scope and timing for the landfill rehabilitation and closure works will affect the ability of council to carry out landfill operations and waste related activities on the landfill site. Where possible  landfill rehabilitation designs will maximise the potential future uses of the site after initial rehabilitation works and following final landfill closure.The Engineering & Technical Services department is responsible for landfill delivery  and closed landfill maintenance and monitoring. The Waste Solutions department is responsible for managing the landfill operations and waste related activities on the site.

We require the LiDAR (or similar) data to be classified according to reflector type  and processed to create as-built data for coastal assets giving data such as crest heights.

The consequence of this is that we are limited in the number of locations and cameras that can be viewed at any one time reducing the visibility of sites and staff and our overview of critical incidents.• This team manages access control for 197 separate buildings and 282 building alarm systems but have no sitemaps displayed to identify door locations or alarms. This inhibits the quick identification of the actual location of alarm activations.• They have the capability to remotely lock down 181 council sites but no planning or operational space to deploy to.
