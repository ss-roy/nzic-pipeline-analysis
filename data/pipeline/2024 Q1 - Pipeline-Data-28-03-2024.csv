IP009238,9/03/2024,Waikato District Council,Raglan Art Centre Carpark.,The carpark suffers from major cracking and lifting of the surfacing  due to poor ground water drainage which has weakened the subgrade. After a full site analysis  the following limitations have been identified as key requirements to adhere to for project delivery success and an improved asset value using cost vs benefits.  Site constraints: An existing concrete retaining wall will be undermined if full pavement rehab or any ground improvements are suggested. If incorrect construction methodology  design and specifications are not suitability assessed against the constraints the works will not deliver value. Ground water needs diverting or stormwater management as part of extending the longevity of the new assets.  The ground conditions have localised saturated weak spots  an engineered solution is required  rather than the normal pavement rehab.  The carpark design requires a long-term asset improvement not just a repair  The design needs to allow for differential heights  water surface run off  working within confined area  limited budget  and approvals from the Heritage NZ.  The existing concrete retaining wall has been structurally analysed to be a high risk to the car parking works  therefore  to be counted as part of the carparking package of works.

In urban situations such as in Huntly and Ngaruawahia  the adequacy of distribution can be determined by comparing travel distance from households to the nearest playground. In Council’s strategy a simple 800m radius ‘as the crow flies” has been adopted for the local catchment of each playground in urban situations. This would provide most households with a playground within a ten-minute walk.Council’s 2017 Playground Strategy identified a number of playgrounds for renewal. However  due to funding or the delays during 2020 many of the proposals did not eventuate. Through the 2021 LTP additional funding was sought to “catch-up”.

The outcomes of the IBC has been discussed between the Inter Regional Journeys Portfolio and the SNP  with agreement to advance the above SSI treatments. The findings and recommendations of the IBC have informed this funding application. The IBC makes a recommendation of a wide centreline treatment for these sections of state highway (Taupo Airport to Waitahanui). These draft findings are under review by the IRJ portfolio  in the context of the Safe System Approach. The Safe System Approach suggests that corridors with traffic volumes &gt;6 000 vehicles per day (AADT) and a speed limit &gt; 80 km/hr should be addressed with a median barrier to reduce head on risk. A median barrier treatment is supported by the traffic volumes on the corridor and the speed limits subsequent to the speed review noted above. This application seeks funding to design a median barrier treatment for this section  whilst further review of the findings of the draft IBC  and any ongoing consultation  is undertaken during the design process. A design approach is proposed that makes provision for a final decision on whether to proceed with a median barrier or wide centreline treatment (using the same cross section as for median barrier) to be made prior to an application for implementation funding. The design phase will start with elements that are consistent with both treatments (median barrier or wide centreline).",,In Planning,Fully funded,To be determined,To be determined,Waikato,,,Transport,50 - 100 million,,,,,,,2021-Q2,2028-Q2,,,,,

NZTA_149142021,25/03/2024,NZ Transport Agency Waka Kotahi,SH2 Hewletts Road Sub area Access.,SH2/Hewletts Rd is a nationally strategic corridor and is one of three current journeys between the two sides of the Tauranga Harbour. The corridor has multiple and often competing functions  including:1.Providing access to Mount Maunganui  Pāpāmoa  and eastern communities within Western Bay of Plenty (WBOP)2.Providing access to several community facilities such as sport and recreational facilities3.Providing freight access to the Mount Maunganui side of the Port of Tauranga and the Mount Maunganui industrial area which also includes the airport and other key commercial activities such as building supply sites.The purpose of this project is to deliver firstly an Indicative Business Case and secondly a Detailed Business Case which will outline a plan to deliver on the aspirations and outcomes for the SH2/Hewletts Rd corridor and sub area  as set out by the Western Bay of Plenty Urban Form + Transport Initiative (UFTI). This project is a first priority project for the Western Bay or Plenty Transport System Plan Governance Group (TSP).With significant existing travel volumes in each direction using SH2/Hewletts Rd and further growth expected in the eastern corridor (the SmartGrowth endorsed UFTI Connected Centres programme estimates a further 40 000 plus dwellings)  the project aims to identify and deliver interventions to support a reliable and multi-modal journey experience and to improve and maintain the effective operation of SH2/Hewletts Rd and the local transport system. The outcomes sought for SH2/Hewletts Rd and the transport system within the project scope are:1.Reduce road deaths and serious injuries for all users2.Increase PT and active travel mode shift for journeys between the two sides of the harbour3.Maintain freight and commercial vehicles accessibility during off-peak periods4.Provide accessibility between Mt Maunganui and the eastern side of the harbour  and Te Papa peninsular5.Reduce the transport related environmental effects and emissionsThe partners of this project are:1.Ngāti Kuku and Ngāi Tukairangi 2.Bay of Plenty Regional Council 3.Tauranga City Council 4.Waka Kotahi It is noted that the consequence of not achieving the project outcomes is that additional demand will be applied to Turret Rd/15th Ave and SH29A (which also provide access between the two sides of the Tauranga Harbour).,,Early Planning,Funding source to be confirmed,To be determined,To be determined,Bay of Plenty,,,Transport,1 - 5 million,,,,,,,2021-Q3,2024-Q2,,,,,

Note traffic counts from a week in November 2017 showed volumes at over 20 000 a day across the Waingawa Bridge. The SH2 Masterton to Carterton corridor project has been identified as a high-risk corridor  with an indicative treatment philosophy of Safer Corridors (medium-high collective risk  low-medium to medium personal risk). Through investigation and using the SSI toolkit guidance  it is considered that median protection and roadside hazard protection safety interventions are the most cost effective and necessary safe system interventions.

IP009967,5/12/2023,Auckland Council,Waitakere War Memorial Remedial Works.,Waitakere War Memorial is an Auckland Council closed landfill located in Waitakere village in rural north west of Auckland. The 2ha landfill was operated as a bale fill landfill between March 1981 to February 1982. The landfill site is used primarily as a recreational park with limited and informal sports facilities  and there is also a small community hall  playground and skate park on the site. The site is considered as a high-risk site by the Auckland Council Closed Landfill and Contaminated Land Response team (CLCLR) and has the highest annual expenditure per landfill size within CLCLR’s portfolio. This is due to the cartage and trade waste disposal costs associated with high leachate generation from the site. The site also contains landfill gas which has the potential to migrate toward nearby receptors such as the adjacent community hall.,,Early planning,Funding source confirmed,Selective,Construct only,Auckland,,,Other not specified,1 - 5 million,,2020-Q3,,2021-Q1,,2024-Q2,2020-Q3,2024-Q2,,,procurement@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz,,

IP009970,5/12/2023,Auckland Council,Claris Landfill Rehabilitation and Closure Works.,The Claris Landfill on Great Barrier Island provides essential services to the local community. The landfill receives household  commercial waste and septic tank wastes for permanent disposal to ground at the site. It is the only waste disposal facility on the island and existing consents allow for this until 2027. The site is also currently used for waste related activities to consolidate and temporarily store materials  such as glass  metal  and plastics  prior to their transport off the island. Consents require council to prepare a landfill closure plan to identify the works needed for final landfill closure and to provide for future landfill aftercare arrangements.Waste has been placed outside the consented boundary  and in some areas waste has been filled outside consented design elevation and the 4H:1V outside batter profiles. Outside batter slopes are approaching 1H:1V in some areas. This means that the landfill is not compliant with consent conditions. Council is required to rehabilitate the landfill to achieve compliance with consents. The landfill closure plan and final designs will also be developed as part of the rehabilitation project. The final scope and staging for the rehabilitation and closure works will be confirmed following the investigation phase and development of preliminary design options.The scope and timing for the landfill rehabilitation and closure works will affect the ability of council to carry out landfill operations and waste related activities on the landfill site. Where possible  landfill rehabilitation designs will maximise the potential future uses of the site after initial rehabilitation works and following final landfill closure.The Engineering & Technical Services department is responsible for landfill delivery  and closed landfill maintenance and monitoring. The Waste Solutions department is responsible for managing the landfill operations and waste related activities on the site.

We also have a responsibility to understand natural hazards along the whole coastline  including current erosion rates of cliffs and changes in beach levels. We need topographical  photographic or similar data to be collected along our coastline to inform our asset management  to understand our hazard exposure  and to provide a baseline for future erosion studies. We anticipate that this will comprise high-resolution oblique LiDAR with RGB photography flown at low altitude from a helicopter or similar  but are open to alternative methods that can meet our objectives. We require the LiDAR (or similar) data to be classified according to reflector type  and processed to create as-built data for coastal assets giving data such as crest heights. We also require the LiDAR data to be compared against previous LiDAR data collected in 2019 for cliffs on the North Shore to identify changes and give an assessment of the rate of coastal erosion.,,In planning,Funding source confirmed,Selective,Construct only,Auckland,,,Other not specified,1 - 5 million,2021-Q2,2022-Q4,,2022-Q4,,,2023-Q2,2023-Q4,,,procurement@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz,,

The consequence of this is that we are limited in the number of locations and cameras that can be viewed at any one time reducing the visibility of sites and staff and our overview of critical incidents.• This team manages access control for 197 separate buildings and 282 building alarm systems but have no sitemaps displayed to identify door locations or alarms. This inhibits the quick identification of the actual location of alarm activations.• They have the capability to remotely lock down 181 council sites but no planning or operational space to deploy to. As a result  it is difficult to assemble members of the security team together in one space in the event of a significant event to coordinate a response.• On average the security team is responding to 80-100 security incidents a month of varying degrees of severity while dealing with over 70 CCTV requests from Police and council business units.• The Security Specialists often deal with sensitive and confidential which is currently being managed in an unrestricted  open plan office environment.• The building management system (BMS) controls and monitors the HVAC controls  lighting and security systems  it ensures that the building is operating efficiently and effectively  it can also detect various alarms  including fire alarms and security alarms.

The rationale was that the area identified will only be used as a media room for a very small percentage of time and that it can be used as meeting rooms by the rest of the building tenants as and when required. The basis of utilization would be that it is first and foremost a media room and that media requirements will take precedence over normal meetings.
